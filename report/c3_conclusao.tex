\chapter{Preliminary Conclusions}
The management and monitoring of clinical trial data is a arduous task for the researchers within the UIC, who have to contribute a considerable amount of effort and time into organizing the overview of clinical trials. To decrease this burden and optimize the management of clinical trials, the platform CASCIFFO has been proposed.

In this report, the functional requirements of the platform CASCIFFO are presented, accompanied by visual user interfaces depicting how these objectives will be achieved as a result of their analysis and specification.
