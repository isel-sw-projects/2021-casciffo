\chapter{Conclusion}
The management and monitoring of clinical trial data, is a arduous task for the researchers within the UIC, who have to contribute a considerable amount of effort and time into organizing the overview of clinical trials. To decrease this burden and optimize the management of clinical trials, the platform CASCIFFO has been proposed. 
This thesis has given me the chance to input my knowledge acquired throughout my academic path in Licenciatura and Mestrado em Engenharia Inform√°tica e de Computadores, being able to consolidate it into the platform CASCIFFO, and making a contribution to a cause I find very important.
Throughout the current development of this thesis, I've had the on-going opportunity to meet and discuss with the HFF/UIC team that is collaborating in the development of CASCIFFO, to solidify the groundwork for the platform. The groundwork consists of how the proposed functional requirements will be met through the usage of mock user interfaces, presented throughout this report.
To conclude, the goal of this thesis is being achieved within an acceptable time-frame.
