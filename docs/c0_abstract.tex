This document presents a thesis made on a joint-project named CASCIFFO, between the Lisbon Superior Institute of Engineering - Instituto Superior de Engenharia Lisboa (ISEL), and the Hospital Professor Doutor Fernando Fonseca (HFF). This project was made possible through the funding earned from the Clinical Investigation Agency Award and Biomedical Innovation (AICIB). 
This thesis aims to develop a platform and provide innovative mechanisms for interoperability with internal or external information systems, allowing, when desired, data synchronization, index search, identification data management and even access to detailed clinical data, the ability to manage and monitor clinical trials as well as their participants within the Clinical Research Center. 
The main contribution of this thesis will the optimization and simplicity in managing clinical trials in order to facilitate the researchers efforts in the management of clinical trials.
We believe this platform to be an important step in the modernization of the HFF and UIC, bringing change in how the researchers view their institute and its importance. 
This is report aims to specify the functional requisites of in the platform CASCIFFO and situate the current status of development within the expected timeline.
