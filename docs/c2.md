This chapter consists of the introduction of the agencies involved in this application, as well as give a detailed view on the goals to be achieved in this thesis.

## 1 Introduction

The [Hospital Professor Doutor Fernando Fonseca (HFF)](https://hff.min-saude.pt/), is a first of the line hospital for the near 550.000 habitants of the municipalities of Amadora and Sintra.
The Institution develops assistance and investigation activities as well as providing education, pre- and post-graduation training.

The Hospital's mission is to provide humanized and differentiated health care throughout a person's life cycle, in collaboration with primary and continuing health care, as well as other hospitals in the National Health Service's ("Serviço Nacional de Saúde") network.

The Clinical Investigation Unit ("Unidade de Investigação Clínica", UIC), created in March 2018, is an internal department within the Hospital that incorporated fundamental concepts of activities in line with the strategic objectives of the institution. The UIC is responsible for managing Clinical Investigations and is characterized by a multidisciplinary team responsible for ensuring accuracy in the scientific planning of the studies submitted, for the fulfillment of clinical best practices by researchers and for the negotiation of contracts for projects financed by external promoters.  
UIC's mission is to promote quality Clinical Investigation in an organized and sustainable manner, following guidelines that value systematic knowledge through the management of interfaces associated with Investigation, Development, and Innovation, and complying with applicable ethical and legal provisions, for the benefit of the Hospital, the Community, the Patients, and the Families/Caregivers.  
The goal is to become a reference of the promotion of best practices in hospital clinical research and to consolidate a transversal scientific culture within the institution.  

Clinical Investigations are very important to the world of medicine and health care, since it's through them that new medicine and new ways of treatment are discovered and tested through adherence to strict scientific accuracy measurements and best practices before being administrated to the public. There are two main types of Clinical Investigations, without intervention, which includes Observational Trials ("Estudos Observacionais"), and with intervention, which includes Clinical Trials ("Ensaios Clínicos"), Clinical Investigations with intervention of medical devices and Clinical Investigations of cosmetic and body hygiene products.  
Observational Trials consist purely of observation, for example in the evaluation of a potential risk factor. On the other hand, Clinical Investigations with intervention can be characterized as any intervention that foresees any alteration, influence or change in schedule of health care in the behavior or knowledge of the participating patients or caretakers, with the end goal of discovering the effects it had on the participant's health.   
Clinical Trials consist of a scientific controlled investigation, done on humans (healthy or ill), with the end-goal of establishing or confirming the safety and efficiency of experimental medicine.  

Clinical Trials have shown to be a vital tool in the development and testing of vaccinations and treatments for the safety of the entire world population during the present Covid19 pandemic.  
The current procedure of a Clinical Investigation relies on email exchanges with the parties involved, which adds an unnecessary amount of effort in order to search through a great amount of emails. This complicates the management of Clinical Trials, from having an overview to the tracking of the state and state history of a particular Clinical Investigation. This inconvenience can cause a significant delay in the Clinical Investigation. Another concern is with the scheduling and monitoring of Clinical Trials patients, as there is little differentiation between the types of appointments made for each patient.  
In this context, the application detailed in this document, CASCIFFO, will provide a solution to enhance the efficiency in the management of Clinical Investigations.


## 2 CASCIFFO

CASCIFFO is a joint project between [HFF](https://hff.min-saude.pt/) and [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/). It concerns the application to the Clinical Investigation Agency Award and Biomedical Innovation (AICIB).  
CASCIFFO is a platform that aligns with the UIC's goals by promoting efficiency and quality in the management of clinical research.
CASCIFFO strives to make the visualization, monitoring, and management of clinical Trials as simple and straightforward as possible.   
It will allow the UIC/HFF to be modernized, bringing a shift in how patients, researchers, and promoters view and value their institution.  

The application aims to develop and provide innovative mechanisms for interoperability with internal and external information systems, allowing, when desired, data synchronization, index search, identification data management and even access to detailed clinical data. 
CASCIFFO consists of two core modules, the front-end and the back-end. The front-end supports interaction with users while the back-end connects to an internal database system to the HFF/UIC and which aggregates the total information of this ecosystem.  
The interaction with users will depend on their role within the platform, displaying the appropriate information to each one.
